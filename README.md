# Heart Disease Risk Predictor

A web application that uses Machine Learning and AI to provide early and reliable cardiovascular risk assessments based on patient health data.

---

## Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment can save lives by enabling timely medical interventions. This project use Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning model to predict the risk of heart disease using common health parameters.

The app provides an easy-to-use interface to input patient data and delivers accurate risk predictions with confidence scores and recommendations.

## Features

- **Accurate AI predictions** based on trained machine learning models  
- **User-friendly interface** built with Streamlit  
- **Confidence scores** to indicate prediction certainty  
- **Clear health recommendations** based on risk level  
- Fast and accessible cardiovascular risk assessment  

---

## Technologies Used
